# LSTM Next-Word Prediction App (Hamlet Dataset)

This is a Streamlit-based web application that uses LSTM models trained on Shakespeare's *Hamlet* to perform next-word prediction. Users can input a seed sentence and choose how many words they want the model to generate. The app also allows switching between 2 pre-trained RNN models.

## Features

- ðŸ“œ Predict the next N words from any given seed sentence
- ðŸ§  Choose between multiple LSTM models trained on the Hamlet dataset
- ðŸ§° Uses Keras + TensorFlow backend for prediction
- ðŸŽ¨ Built with Streamlit for a clean web interface
